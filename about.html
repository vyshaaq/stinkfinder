        <p class="intro-text">Caesar-M (Comments Analysis and Evaluation Screening Algorithm for Rogue Detection in Malayalam) is designed to
        proficiently identify and manage rogue words, local slang, and slurs in Malayalam YouTube comments. Inspired by Thankan
        Chettan, a character known for his unfiltered language, this model aims to foster cleaner online discourse. Utilizing
        advanced tools like TensorFlow, Caesar-M will be trained on a substantial dataset of Malayalam text, targeting an
        accuracy rate of over 90%. Employing effective machine learning techniques and natural language processing methods, it
        ensures robust performance in real-world applications while understanding the nuances of the Malayalam dialect.</p>
